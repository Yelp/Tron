Tron - Batch Scheduling System
==============================

[![Build Status](https://github.com/Yelp/Tron/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?query=branch%3Amaster)](https://github.com/Yelp/Tron/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/tron/badge/?version=latest)](http://tron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Tron is a centralized system for managing periodic batch processes
across a cluster. If you find [cron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) or
[fcron](http://fcron.free.fr/) to be insufficient for managing complex work
flows across multiple computers, Tron might be for you.

Install with:

    > sudo pip install tron

Or look at the [tutorial](http://tron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html).

The full documentation is available [on ReadTheDocs](http://tron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Versions / Roadmap
------------------

Tron is changing and under active development.

It is being transformed from an ssh-based execution engine to be compatible with running on [Kubernetes
](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/).

Tron development is specifically targeting Yelp's needs and not designed to be
a general solution for other companies.
