        # dictionary representation of the state. This allows the method to be used in a more flexible and generic way,
        # enabling different classes to implement their own specific logic for converting the dictionary into an instance of the
        # class. By returning a dictionary, the method provides a common interface for deserialization, while allowing subclasses
