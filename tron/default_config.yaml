ssh_options:
    ## Tron needs SSH keys to allow the effective user to login to each of the
    ## nodes specified in the "nodes" section. You can choose to use either an
    ## SSH agent or list
    # identities:
    #     - /home/tron/.ssh/id_dsa
    agent: true

# notification_options:
    ## In case of trond failures, where should we send notifications to ?
    # smtp_host: localhost
    # notification_addr: nobody@localhost

## Directory used to store stdout/stderr from jobs and services. Defaults
## to the working directory
# output_stream_dir: /tmp/tron/streams/

#state_persistence:
    ## Configuration for how to store Tron state data
    # name: 'shelve'
    # store_type: 'tron_State.shelve'
    # connection_details:
    # buffer_size:

nodes:
    ## You'll need to list out all the available nodes for doing work.
    # - name: "node"
    #   hostname: 'localhost'
    #   username: 'tronuser'

## Optionally you can list 'pools' of nodes where selection of a node will
## be randomly determined or jobs can be configured to be run on all nodes
## in the pool
# node_pools:
    # - name: NodePool
    #   nodes: [node]

command_context:
    # Variable subsitution
    # There are some built-in values such as 'node', 'runid', 'actionname' and
    # run-time based variables such as 'shortdate'. (See tronfig.1 for
    # reference.) You can specify whatever else you want similiar to
    # environment variables:
    # PYTHON: "/usr/bin/python"

jobs:
    ## Configure your jobs here by specifing a name, node, schedule and the
    ## work flow that should executed.
    # - name: "sample_job"
    #   node: node
    #   schedule: "daily"
    #   actions:
    #     - name: "uname"
    #       command: "uname -a"
    #   cleanup_action:
    #     command: "rm -rf /tmp/sample_job_scratch"

    ## Configure services here. Services differ from jobs in that they are
    ## expected to have an enable/disable and monitoring phase.
    # - name: "sample_service"
    #   node: node
    #   count: 2
    #   pid_file: "/var/run/%(name)s-%(instance_number)s.pid"
    #   command: "run_service --pid-file=%(pid_file)s start"
    #   monitor_interval: 20
