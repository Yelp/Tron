tronweb
========
Tron comes with a simple but functional web-based UI to tronview. You can use tronweb to view your jobs and drill down
into individual job runs, actions and action output. Currently, tronweb.py lives in the web/ directory of the tron
source distribution. 

Installation
------------
You can run tronweb directly from the tron source distribution. It will require the tron package to be installed, and
depends on `Tornado <http://www.tornadoweb.org>`_. 

Running tronweb
----------------
Before you run tronweb, you'll need to set up a config.py file in the tronweb root directory. An example config
file is included, config.py.example. The config file only includes a few attributes, most of which are self-explanatory::

  config={
    'port' : 8888,
    'trond_url' :'http://localhost:8089',
    'output_url' : "http://foo.bar.com/jobs/{job}/{run}/{action}"
  }

'port' defines the port tronweb runs on to handle requests. 'trond_url' is the url that trond listens on for requests. You can
generally leave these two fields as is.

'output_url' is used by tronweb to build the url used for downloading job output. In our case, we use apache to serve these files
as they can be quite large. job/run/action will be replaced by the job name, job run name, and action name -- which map directly
to the path on disk where trond stores output files. For example, given run 10 of the job 
'call_center_report' with a single action 'report', the url mapping above will generate stdout and stderr links of::

  http://foo.bar.com/jobs/call_center_report/call_center_report.10/call_center_report.10.report.stdout
  http://foo.bar.com/jobs/call_center_report/call_center_report.10/call_center_report.10.report.stderr

Once you have confg.py sorted, you simply start the server by running it::

  python tronweb.py # or
  nohup python tronweb.py &

That's it.
