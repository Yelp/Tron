Tron
====

Tron is a centralized system for managing periodic batch processes and services
across a cluster. If this is your first time using Tron, read :doc:`tutorial`
and :doc:`overview` to get a better idea of what it is, how it works, and how
to use it.

.. note::

    The HTML documentation is a work in progress, but is checked more closely
    than other resources such as the Github wiki. When sources disagree,
    the HTML documentation is considered canonical.

    Please report bugs in the documentation at `our Github issue tracker
    <http://www.github.com.com/yelp/Tron/issues>`_.
