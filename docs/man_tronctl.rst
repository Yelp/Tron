``tronctl [--server <host:port>] [--verbose] <command> <job_name | job_run_id | action_run_id | service_name>``

Description
-----------

**tronctl** is the control interface for Tron. :command:`tronctl` allows you to
enable, disable, start, stop and cancel Tron Jobs and Services.

Options
-------

``--server=<config-file>``
    Config file containing the address of the server the tron instance is running on

``--verbose``
        Displays status messages along the way

``--run-date=<YYYY-MM-DD>``

Job Commands
------------

disableall
    Disables all jobs

enableall
    Enables all jobs

disable <job_name>
    Disables the job. Cancels all scheduled and queued runs. Doesn't
    schedule any more.

enable <job_name>
    Enables the job and schedules a new run.

start <job_name>
    Creates a new run of the specified job and runs it immediately.

start <job_run_id>
    Attempt to start the given job run. A Job run only starts if no
    other instance is running. If the job has already started, it will attempt
    to start any actions in the SCH or QUE state.

start <action_run_id>
    Attempt to start the action run.

restart <job_run_id>
    Creates a new job run with the same run time as this job.

cancel <job_run_id | action_run_id>
    Cancels the specified job run or action run.

success <job_run_id | action_run_id>
    Marks the specified job run or action run as succeeded.  This behaves the
    same as the run actually completing.  Dependant actions are run and queued
    runs start.

skip <action_run_id>
    Marks the specified action run as skipped.  This allows dependant actions
    to run.

fail <job_run_id | action_run_id>
    Marks the specified job run or action run as failed.  This behaves the same
    as the job actually failing.

stop <action_run_id>
