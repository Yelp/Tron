    Commit: Catch all exceptions in k8s submit_command() (#926)  It's
    entirely possible that creating a task_processing task (and/or
    submitting one) can result in an exception. At the moment, this
    results in the affected ActionRun getting stuck in the Starting
    state - but this is a lie and means that the normal
    monitoring/alerting on failed runs does not kick in.

    Commit: COMPINFRA-2565: enforce an upper limit on backfill
    concurrency (#906)  Problem  ----- The Kubernetes control plane can
    be overwhelmed if a high number of concurrent backfills are
    executed. We currently set a relatively high default of  and enforce
    no upper limit at all.  Solution ----- * Reduce the default  from
    to  to reduce the baseline pressure of Tron backfill jobs. *
    Introduce and enforce a hard limit of  concurrent backfills per
    tronctl invocation  In a future PR, we might want to track the total
    count of running backfills per user in Zookeeper but this change
    should already safeguard against overwhelming Tron with backfills in
    the meantime.  Signed-off-by: Max Falk <gfalk@yelp.com>

    conditions to detect an abnormal exit and actually 'fail' the

    removes spark_driver_service_account_name - I'm not sure what I was
    thinking initially - we don't really need anything to distinguish
    between the driver and executor SA since the executor SA is
    configured by the arguments used to start the driver (and thus we
    can just start the driver pod as we normally would by using the
    service account payload that we'd use for a normal tron-launched
    pod)

    but that'll come next.  With this, we should be giving task_proc all
    the information it needs to actually create a usable Pod.

    Commit: Add black for formatting + some additional linters (#805)
    We don't have any automatically enforced formatting (yapf is
    optional and not part of our pre-commit), so let's use black since
    that seems to be what we've settled on.  Additionally, I've added
    some other 'standard' pre-commit hooks (as well as reformatted the
    pre-commit config file.)

    Commit: Add initial k8s config + global k8s toggle + job opt-out
    (#802)  We'll be adding two toggles to control Tron's usage of k8s:
    * a global killswitch (k8s_options['enabled']) for when we want to
    go   back to Mesos for an entire cluster (and, in the future, for
    when we   want to quickly stop all Tronjobs). * a per-job opt-out ()
    for any jobs that encounter issues with   k8s or that we want to
    migrate at a specific time.  Since I was adding a k8s config section
    to the Tron master config, I also went ahead and added a way to
    configure what the k8s API address should be (i.e., the 'master'
    address).

  * 1.7.0 tagged with 'make release'
    Commit: Implementation of skip-and-publish (#789)  Skipping an
    action that has downstream triggers is error-prone as its easy to
    forget that you have triggers to emit and what triggers to emit. You
    probably need to go check your tronfig definitions to see what
    triggers exist and converting the trigger name to a trigger command
    can be a little tricky (with date magic).  To solve this, we add a
    new tronctl command that will skip an action and then publish all
    triggers for that action.
