    file, we continue using the age-old pattern for atomic file updates:
    write to another file and swap a symlink once the write is complete

    results in the affected ActionRun getting stuck in the Starting

    executed. We currently set a relatively high default of  and enforce
    no upper limit at all.  Solution ----- * Reduce the default  from
    to  to reduce the baseline pressure of Tron backfill jobs. *
    Introduce and enforce a hard limit of  concurrent backfills per
    tronctl invocation  In a future PR, we might want to track the total
    count of running backfills per user in Zookeeper but this change
    should already safeguard against overwhelming Tron with backfills in

    removes spark_driver_service_account_name - I'm not sure what I was
    thinking initially - we don't really need anything to distinguish
    between the driver and executor SA since the executor SA is
    configured by the arguments used to start the driver (and thus we
    can just start the driver pod as we normally would by using the
    service account payload that we'd use for a normal tron-launched
    pod)

    Commit: Allow users to use runid for triggers (#853)  Some users
    have jobs whose output depends on the output of the previous run -
    for critical jobs, it's useful to explicitly declare this dependency
    so that these jobs never run unless Tron knows that the previous
    output is ready/complete (using successful completion as a proxy for
    this)  For additional context:

    this for Pod Identity - there's a webhook that will inject a secret
    token + some environment variables if a Pod has a Service Account
    set up.  paasta-tools will be in charge of creating the Service
    Account that we'll use if it doesn't exist (as well as setting up
    the annotations on that Service Account).

    KubernetesTaskConfig was invalid and that the ActionRun would never

    (#802)  We'll be adding two toggles to control Tron's usage of k8s:
    * a global killswitch (k8s_options['enabled']) for when we want to
    go   back to Mesos for an entire cluster (and, in the future, for
    when we   want to quickly stop all Tronjobs). * a per-job opt-out ()
    for any jobs that encounter issues with   k8s or that we want to
    migrate at a specific time.  Since I was adding a k8s config section
    to the Tron master config, I also went ahead and added a way to
    configure what the k8s API address should be (i.e., the 'master'
    address).

    Commit: Implementation of skip-and-publish (#789)  Skipping an
    action that has downstream triggers is error-prone as its easy to
    forget that you have triggers to emit and what triggers to emit. You
    probably need to go check your tronfig definitions to see what
    triggers exist and converting the trigger name to a trigger command
    can be a little tricky (with date magic).  To solve this, we add a
    new tronctl command that will skip an action and then publish all
    triggers for that action.
